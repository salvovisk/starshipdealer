# Starship Dealer
This is a small web app developed with React and Bootstrap.

It displays a list, in form of cards, of popular and fictional Starships, with details such as manufacturer, model or cargo capacity.

The project aim was to use Redux.
So the App started with props and useState, then Redux was implemented in the "redux-implementation" branch.
There's also a non functional log-in interaction just for the purpose of state changing.



For the database i used MockServer, and made concurrent script to run MockServer and react server.

use the command <br>
``` npm run dev ```
